## [Unreleased]

### Added

- ssh session discovery + respawn: `SshSource::list` discovers sessions on a
  host by joining live tmux sessions (`list-sessions` + per-session
  `show-environment` metadata) with stopped worktrees (`git worktree list`),
  scoped to configured projects. `attach` now runs a `has-session` liveness
  preflight and returns `SessionNotFound` for a missing session instead of
  optimistically attaching. `respawn` re-creates a stopped session's tmux
  session without re-adding its surviving worktree, fail-closed on a vanished
  worktree directory (`test -d` preflight) and attaching to the live session
  if a concurrent respawner won the `new-session` race. New transport-agnostic
  `discovery` module (pure parse + join of untrusted sandbox output, ADR-0004)
  and `naming` inverses (`parse_tmux_session_name`, `parse_worktree_path`).
- ssh transport (attach): `SshSource` opens a PTY channel to an existing
  remote tmux session over ssh (`tmux attach-session -d`), streaming bytes
  both ways and propagating resize, on a reusable `transport::pty_process`
  bridge. `naming::tmux_session_name` centralizes the
  `remora_<project>_<session>` convention. `spawn`/`list` are stubbed for
  later stages. Adds the `portable-pty` dependency.
- Project scaffold: pnpm + Cargo workspaces, Tauri 2 desktop app skeleton,
  `remora-core` / `remora-protocol` crates, CI, and community docs.
